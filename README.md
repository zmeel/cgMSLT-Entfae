How was [Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004_cgMLST.gff3](https://github.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/blob/main/Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004_cgMLST.gff3) created?<br>
1) The [sequence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/main/Enterococcus%20faecium%20strain%20Aus0004.fasta) of the reference strain Enterococcus faecium Aus0004 was imported in SeqSphere+ and run throught the cgMLST scheme.<br>
2) The [results](https://github.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/blob/main/Enterococcus_faecium_cgMLST_scheme.fasta) were exported and used in 3) <br>
3) The table [filtered_sequences.csv](https://github.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/blob/main/filtered_sequences.csv) was created by combining [Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004.gff3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/main/Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004.gff3), [Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004.ffn.fasta](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/main/Enterococcus_faecium_Aus0004.ffn.fasta) and [Enterococcus_faecium_cgMLST_scheme.fasta](https://github.com/zmeel/cgMSLT-Entfae/blob/main/Enterococcus_faecium_cgMLST_scheme.fasta)<br>
